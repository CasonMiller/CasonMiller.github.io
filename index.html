        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            I am a junior pursuing an undergraduate degree in Management Information Systems (MIS) within the Price College of Business at the University of Oklahoma.
            I am interested data analysis, business intelligence, and data science.
            I believe that the skills and information that I have learned from my business relevant classes and previous work experiences have prepared me to take on 
            more challenges and improve myself through new work opportunities.
